Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate credit card fraud detection model using supervised learning classification techniques in the finance sector. The model should be able to classify transactions or activities into binary classes: "fraudulent" and "non-fraudulent" based on historical available data and the significant features.

The dataset provided for this project contains historically available transaction data, where each transaction is described by a set of features. These features include customer information, transaction amount, transaction date and time, credit card information and other relevant details. Additionally, each transaction is classified as either "fraudulent" or "non-fraudulent‚Äù.
